    "In classical physics, the distance between two points in space is given by the Pythagorean theorem, and is independent of time. The distance $d$ between two points in a three-dimensional space with coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is given by:\n",

    "In special relativity, distances and time can vary according to the observer's frame of reference. To account for this, we introduce the concept of *spacetime intervals*, which combine both spatial and temporal dimensions and do not depend on the observer's motion.\n",
