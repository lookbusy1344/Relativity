    "This concept suggests that an object's mass increases as its velocity approaches the speed of light. However, this idea is outdated in modern physics. Mass normally refers to rest mass or proper mass, which is constant.\n",

    "The relativistic mass is no higher than the rest mass!\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are accelerating something in a different reference frame, like a particle accelerator moving protons, or a Earth-based laser shining on a ship with a light sail, relativistic mass does indeed come into play. At the object speeds up (relative to the accelerator) the Lorentz factor increases, and it gets harder to accelerate.\n",

It doesn't matter that you and the ship may be travelling at 0.999c from a particular frame, you can't discover that while on board (unless you look to see how fast the Earth is approaching, and then it could be the Earth thats moving and not you).\n",

    "## No absolute motion, it's all relative\n",

    "When not accelerating, all inertial frames are equivalent. There is no test you can perform to find your \"true\" velocity, you are essentially stationary.\n",

    "Everything on board ship remains exactly the same. Its the outside universe (in a different frame) that changes.\n",
