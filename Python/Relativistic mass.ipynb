    "# Relativistic mass and Proper acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of 'relativistic mass' suggests that an object's mass increases as its velocity approaches the speed of light. However, this idea is outdated in modern physics. Mass normally refers to *rest mass* or *proper mass*, which is constant.\n",

    "- *Coordinate time*: means the time in the background frame of reference you think of as stationary (eg on Earth)\n",
