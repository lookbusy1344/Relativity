    "# Relativistic Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept suggests that an object's mass increases as its velocity approaches the speed of light. However, this idea is outdated in modern physics. Mass normally refers to *rest mass* or *proper mass*, which is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "But lets explore the concept of relativistic mass in more depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Proper*: means your subjective experience of time, length and acceleration (eg on the ship that's moving). *Proper time* is time for you on ship\n",
    "- *Coordinate*: means the time and length in a background frame of reference you think of as stationary (eg on Earth). *Coordinate time* is time for someone on Earth watching the ship\n",
    "- *Rest mass*: is the real physical mass of an object when it is at rest relative to you (aka *proper mass*). *Rest mass* is the mass of an object on the ship, as you measure it on the ship\n",
    "\n",
    "## Does an object's mass increase as its speed approaches c?\n",
    "\n",
    "### And is this effect what stops us accelerating to light speed?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers here are 'not really' and 'no'!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relativistic mass increase\n",
    "\n",
    "As objects speed up, their relativistic mass increases by the Lorentz factor (which also describes time dilation and length contraction). The Lorentz factor is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the relative velocity of the object and $c$ is the speed of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we calculate the Lorentz factor for a range of velocities:\n"
