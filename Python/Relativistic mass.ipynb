    "# Relativistic mass and Proper acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of 'relativistic mass' suggests that an object's mass increases as its velocity approaches the speed of light. However, this idea is outdated in modern physics. Mass normally refers to *rest mass* or *proper mass*, which is constant.\n",

    "- *Proper time*: means your subjective experience of time (eg on the ship that's moving)\n",
    "- *Coordinate time*: means the time in the background frame of reference you think of as stationary (eg on Earth)\n",
    "- *Rest mass*: is the real physical mass of an object when it is at rest relative to you (aka *proper mass*)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Does an object's mass increase as its speed approaches c?\n",

    "### ..and is this effect what stops us accelerating to light speed?\n",

    "## Relativistic mass increase\n",
    "\n",
    "As objects speed up, their relativistic mass increases by the Lorentz factor (which also describes time dilation and length contraction). The Lorentz factor is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the relative velocity of the object and $c$ is the speed of light.\n",
