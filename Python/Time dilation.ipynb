    "# Time dilation and length contraction\n",

    "\n",
    "Many amazing aspects of special relativity, including *time dilation* and *length contraction*, can be understood by using the *Lorentz factor*. It expresses how much the measurements of time, length, and other physical properties change for an object while it moves. The Lorentz factor is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the relative velocity between the two bodies and $c$ is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is always greater than or equal to 1, and it approaches infinity as the relative velocity approaches the speed of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time dilation\n",
    "\n",
    "Time dilation is when time slows down for an object in motion relative to an observer. The slowed duration is given by **multiplying the normal duration by the Lorentz factor**. Or in more mathematical terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta t' = \\gamma \\Delta t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a Lorentz factor of 10 (equivalent to a relative speed of about 298,300 km every second), 1 second becomes 10 seconds for an observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Length contraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Length contraction is when an object in motion shortens relative to an observer. The contracted length is given by **dividing the normal length by the Lorentz factor**. Or in more mathematical terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L' = L/\\gamma$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a Lorentz factor of 10, a 1 metre rod becomes 0.1 metres (10 cm) for an observer.\n",
    "\n",

    "What does this mean in practice? Let's imagine a ship is travelling at 0.9c relative to the Earth. If we watch it using a telescope:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time on board slows down, so 1 second on ship takes 2.29 seconds on Earth. To us, the ship appears to be moving in slow motion.\n",
    "- In the direction of travel, lengths get contracted so a 1 metre ruler on ship appears to be only 44cm long from the Earth. To us, the ship appears to be squashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly this effect is completely symmetrical. If someone on the ship uses a telescope to look back at Earth, they will see the same slowing and length contraction! But of course their own length and time flow appear perfectly normal to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the ship seems slowed from Earth, and the Earth seems slowed from the ship, they will disagree about the time of any events they both witness. It's even possible for them to disagree on the order of events, depending on the exact circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Length contraction for interstellar travel\n",
    "\n",
    "Length contraction is also symmetric, so a moving body sees the rest of the universe shrink in its direction of travel. Let’s assume you are on a ship travelling at 0.9c between Earth and Proxima 4.2 light years away. We know the Lorentz factor is 2.29, so that means the distance to Proxima becomes 4.2/2.29 = **1.83 light years**. It actually gets closer!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you are travelling at 0.9c it will take 1.834 / 0.9 = **2.04 years** to make the journey. You have travelled over 4 light years in only 2 years, although you’ve never actually exceeded the speed of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you slow down at Proxima, the universe will expand back to its normal size as the Lorentz factor returns to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this effect, you can cross the entire universe in a human lifetime, see my [tour of the universe notebook](https://github.com/lookbusy1344/Relativity/blob/main/Python/Universe.ipynb) which factors in issues like acceleration.\n",
