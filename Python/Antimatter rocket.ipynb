    "# Antimatter rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is primarily focused on the purely kinematic equations of Special Relativity. However, it also includes some basic equations for an antimatter rocket, in both Python and Typescript. These are used in the interactively in web calculator https://lookbusy1344.github.io/Relativity/\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python propulsion equations are in https://github.com/lookbusy1344/Relativity/blob/main/Python/propulsion.py\n",

    "## Two kinds of antimatter rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic kinds of antimatter rocket:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Photonic rocket: This uses the energy from matter-antimatter annihilation to produce photons (gamma rays) which are emitted out the back of the rocket to produce thrust. This is the simplest kind of antimatter rocket, but is unrealistic because it is very difficult to collimate the gamma rays into a beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Charged-pion rocket: This uses the charged pions produced in proton-antiproton annihilation to produce thrust. The charged pions can be collimated using magnetic fields (you can make the thrust go in a particular direction), making this a more realistic design for an antimatter rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We use the charged-pion rocket equations here"
