    "# Antimatter rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lookbusy1344/Relativity/blob/main/Python/Antimatter%20rocket.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is primarily focused on the purely kinematic equations of Special Relativity. However, it also includes some basic functions for an antimatter rocket, in both Python and Typescript. These are used in the interactive web calculator:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://lookbusy1344.github.io/Relativity/\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python propulsion functions are in https://github.com/lookbusy1344/Relativity/blob/main/Python/propulsion.py\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ultimate fuel - antimatter\n",
    "\n",
    "Antimatter is the most energy-dense fuel possible, with a specific energy of approximately **9x10^16 J/kg** (90 PJ/kg) from proton-antiproton annihilation. This is about **9 billion times** the energy density of chemical fuels like hydrogen-oxygen, and about **3000 times** that of nuclear fission or fusion. To release this energy, matter and antimatter just has to come into contact, annihilating each other and producing high-energy photons (gamma rays) and other particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire rest mass of the fuel is converted into energy, eg for half a gram of antimatter annihilating with half a gram of matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = mc^2 = 0.001 \\text{ kg} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E \\approx 9 \\times 10^{13}\\text{ J}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### TNT Equivalent\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{1 megaton TNT} = 4.184 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ J}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{megatons} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{13}}{4.184 \\times 10^{15}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\approx 0.0215\\text{ megatons}$$\n",
    "$$\\text{1g matter/antimatter} \\approx 21.5 \\text{ kilotons}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So 1 gram of matter/antimatter annihilation releases energy equivalent to **21.5 kilotons** of TNT, almost exactly the yield of the Nagasaki bomb. 1 gram of a dense material like lead (or anti-lead!) has a volume of just 88 mm^3, or a sphere with a diameter of about half a cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly the size of a pea, for an explosion large enough to destroy a city! Less violently, that pea could power 9,000-10,000 homes for a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two kinds of antimatter rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic kinds of antimatter rocket:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Photonic rocket**: using the energy from matter-antimatter annihilation to produce photons (gamma rays) which are emitted out the back of the rocket to produce thrust. This is the simplest kind of antimatter rocket, but is unrealistic because it is very difficult to collimate the gamma rays into a beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Charged-pion rocket**: using charged pions produced in proton-antiproton annihilation to produce thrust. NASA experimental studies show that approximately **40% of the annihilation energy** appears as charged pion kinetic energy that can be magnetically collimated for thrust. The remaining ~60% goes to neutral pions (which decay to gamma rays), pion rest mass energy, and other particles that cannot be efficiently directed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We use the charged-pion rocket equations here\n",
    "\n",
    "This technology is beyond our current capabilities, but is scientifically plausible. We assume various levels of nozzle efficiency to account for engineering challenges in collimating the charged pions. A nozzle efficiency of 85% with 40% energy in charged pions gives **~34% total system efficiency**, which is probably near the maximum achievable.\n",
