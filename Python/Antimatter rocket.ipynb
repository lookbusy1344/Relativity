    "## Two kinds of antimatter rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic kinds of antimatter rocket:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Photonic rocket**: using the energy from matter-antimatter annihilation to produce photons (gamma rays) which are emitted out the back of the rocket to produce thrust. This is the simplest kind of antimatter rocket, but is unrealistic because it is very difficult to collimate the gamma rays into a beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Charged-pion rocket**: using charged pions produced in proton-antiproton annihilation to produce thrust. NASA experimental studies show that approximately **40% of the annihilation energy** appears as charged pion kinetic energy that can be magnetically collimated for thrust. The remaining ~60% goes to neutral pions (which decay to gamma rays), pion rest mass energy, and other particles that cannot be efficiently directed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We use the charged-pion rocket equations here\n",
    "\n",
    "This technology is beyond our current capabilities, but is scientifically plausible. We assume various levels of nozzle efficiency to account for engineering challenges in collimating the charged pions. A nozzle efficiency of 85% with 40% energy in charged pions gives **~34% total system efficiency**, which is probably near the maximum achievable.\n",
