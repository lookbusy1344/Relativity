    "## Two kinds of antimatter rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic kinds of antimatter rocket:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Photonic rocket**: using the energy from matter-antimatter annihilation to produce photons (gamma rays) which are emitted out the back of the rocket to produce thrust. This is the simplest kind of antimatter rocket, but is unrealistic because it is very difficult to collimate the gamma rays into a beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Charged-pion rocket**: using charged pions produced in proton-antiproton annihilation to produce thrust. These charged pions account for about 2/3 of the energy released in proton-antiproton annihilation, with the rest being gamma rays and neutral pions (which quickly decay into gamma rays). The charged pions can be collimated using magnetic fields (you can make the thrust go in a particular direction), making this a more practical design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We use the charged-pion rocket equations here\n",
    "\n",
    "This technology is beyond our current capabilities, but is scientifically plausible. We assume various levels of nozzle efficiency to account for engineering challenges. A nozzle efficiency of 85% (~57% total system efficiency) is probably the maximum achievable."
