    "## Two kinds of antimatter rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic kinds of antimatter rocket:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Photonic rocket: This uses the energy from matter-antimatter annihilation to produce photons (gamma rays) which are emitted out the back of the rocket to produce thrust. This is the simplest kind of antimatter rocket, but is unrealistic because it is very difficult to collimate the gamma rays into a beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Charged-pion rocket: This uses the charged pions produced in proton-antiproton annihilation to produce thrust. The charged pions can be collimated using magnetic fields (you can make the thrust go in a particular direction), making this a more realistic design for an antimatter rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We use the charged-pion rocket equations here\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously this technology is beyond our current capabilities, but is scientifically plausible. We assume various levels of nozzle efficiency to account for engineering challenges. The equations are in propulsion.py, and we use them here to calculate acceleration time and propellant fraction for a charged-pion antimatter rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "85% nozzle efficiency (~57% total system efficiency) is probably the maximum achievable."
