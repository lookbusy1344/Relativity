    "\n",
    "FTL travel is impossible according to our current understanding of physics. Some highly speculative theories propose mechanisms for FTL travel, such as wormholes or warp drives, but these remain purely theoretical and unproven. eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the original paper required **billions of universe masses of negative energy**, more recent work has reduced this to a few solar masses, it is still impossible with any known science.\n",
    "\n",
    "One persistent problem with **any** type of FTL travel (or communication) is the violation of causality, which can lead to paradoxes such as the \"grandfather paradox.\" This is a fundamental issue with Relativity and leads to the following choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relativity\n",
    "- Causality\n",
    "- FTL travel\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick any two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relativity is very well tested, and causality is a foundational principle of physics, so FTL travel is generally considered impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does FTL travel violate causality?\n",
    "\n",
    "FTL would mean travel into the past is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stems from the relativity of simultaneity in Special Relativity. Events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference may not be simultaneous in another frame moving relative to the first. If FTL travel were possible, it would allow information or objects to travel back in time in some frames of reference, leading to causality violations. Here is a detailed example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use our warp drive to travel 4.2 light years to Proxima, instantaneously in our frame of reference.\n",
    "2. We now accelerate to 0.99c.\n",
    "3. In our new boosted frame, we warp back to Earth instantaneously.\n",
    "4. We arrive back on Earth years before we left!\n",
    "\n",
    "These paradoxes are explored in the `ftl_lib.py` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "First lets build a Minkowski diagram to visualise the time travelling mission:"

    "## But doesn't the warp bubble mean causality is preserved?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. The fact that nothing inside the bubble moves faster than light does not mean causality is preserved. The mainstream view in relativity is that **any** spacetime configuration enabling superluminal travel will violate causality, even if locally everything obeys c.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Alcubierre drive seems causal\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the warp bubble, the ship is just “floating” in a region of flat spacetime. Locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ship is at rest relative to its bubble\n",
    "- No object or signal inside the bubble exceeds c\n",
    "- The bubble itself is a distortion of spacetime, not an object moving through spacetime\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why people say “it doesn’t violate relativity” — and that part is true **locally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also reflected in the Alcubierre metric description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But globally, the bubble does violate causality\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that the bubble itself moves faster than light relative to the rest of the universe. And relativity cares about global structure, not just local motion.\n",
    "The crucial point is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anything that moves from one spacetime point to another faster than light\n",
    "- Can be seen in some reference frames as moving backwards in time\n",
    "- Which allows closed timelike curves (time loops)\n",
    "- Which violates causality\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same reason why tachyons or wormholes can create time machines. Even though the ship never breaks the speed of light locally, the warp bubble’s worldline is superluminal, and that’s enough to break causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But what about cosmic expansion?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great comparison. The universe expands faster than light at large scales, so why doesn’t that break causality?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cosmic expansion isn’t motion through space\n",
    "- It’s a change in the metric itself\n",
    "- There’s no way to use expansion to send a signal or object faster than light\n",
    "- No observer sees a signal arriving before it was sent\n",
    "\n",
    "As one commenter put it: “Space itself isn’t moving through space”.\n",
    "The expansion rate isn’t a velocity; it’s a rate of change of distance per unit distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warp bubbles, however, can be arranged to send information from A to B faster than light, and therefore backwards in time in some frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though nothing inside the bubble exceeds c, the bubble itself can create superluminal connections between spacetime points. And in relativity, superluminal connections inevitably allow causality violations.\n",
    "So the Alcubierre drive:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obeys relativity locally\n",
    "- Violates causality globally\n",
    "- Requires exotic matter that may not exist\n",
    "- Might be forbidden by quantum gravity anyway\n",
